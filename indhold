Eye contact video conference system

In the globalised world, communication is of utmost importance and over the last few decades the telephone has developed into a backbone of civilisation.
Communication however can sometimes be difficult over such voice-only systems and therefore modern cellphones, tablets and PC's offer video conferencing. 
These devices are based on a technology where a small camera next to the screen records the user.
Products like Scype, Facetime and Hangout uses this approach.
Even though the technology is widely used, most people agree that the experience is flawed. The primary reason for this is the lack of proper eye contact. 
In this project a video conferencing system with proper eye-contact is developed based on a teleprompter setup. 
The project aims at a low cost, open source, embedded solution communicating over the internet.
